# React-USGS-EarthQuakes

## Project Description
  React-USGS-EarthQuakes is a React Native client for the US Geological Survey's Earthquakes API (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/)  It displays a list of Earthquakes near the user in descending order of magnitude.  Users can select an earthquake from the list to display its epicenter on a map and see additional details related to the event.  The purpose of this app is to demonstrate proficiency with the following technologies:
  * Mobile App Development
  * React Native
  * Expo Framework
  * HTTP API Integration
  * GeoLocation APIs

  Currently, the app's map view does not work on the web due to an incompatibility with react-native-maps in the Expo framework.  Looking for a fix for this.  Future enhancements may also include sorting by distance and event time.

## How to Build
  React-USGS-EarthQuakes requires the Expo framework (https://expo.dev/).  Using expo's command line tools, developers can build the project with the expo CLI with this command: `npx expo run`. Developers can also build the project using EAS build services.  For iOS, you can open the '.xcworkspace' file located in the ios/ directory in XCode and press the 'Build and Run' button.
